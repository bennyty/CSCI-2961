#Open Source Licensing.
[Reading material](http://opensource.org/licenses)

######Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
If a license is not chosen the work is viewed as all rights reserved. This may not be the intended distribution system for the project.

######Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license.
Similar to above, if the project does not list a license it is all rights reserved. If you use an all rights reserved project without special permission you can be sued.

######Android uses Apache license 2.0 and for kernel GPL v2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>, Linux uses GPL v2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux> license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license  <https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr>, SailfishOS is not open source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS>.  Can you justify whysuch a license is chosen (Justify for ONE  is enough). Instead of these four, you can look at any other software project and justify the license chosen for that project.
Linux is based an open source distributed improvement. The GPL license allows all users to use, modify, and distribe Linux in any form for free.
